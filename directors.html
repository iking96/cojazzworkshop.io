    <h2>Hugh Ragin</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/hughragin.jpg" style="float: left" width="150">
    <p>
        Hugh Ragin – inspiring teacher, creative composer and trumpet virtuoso, has been named “a trumpeter with very few peers in terms of imagination or technical command” by jazz biographer Francis Davis in his notes for the “Live At The Knitting Factory” recording with Roscoe Mitchell. Ragin has also collaborated with musicians such as David Murray, Anthony Braxton, Dizzy Gillespie, Spencer Barefield, Fred Wesley, Leo Smith, Sun Ra, Maynard Ferguson, D.D. Jackson, Andrew Cyrille and poet Amiri Baraka, on both recorded and live jazz performances that range from bebop and freebop to the most “out” of avant-garde improvising.
    </p>
    <p>
        His compositions have been recorded by David Murray, Roscoe Mitchell, D.D. Jackson and Fred Wesley, and yet despite his success as a performer and composer, Ragin insists on “being an educator first.” His life has formed as a compassionate gesture “to share the knowledge, and bring more people into music.” For all areas of his teaching, Ragin puts a strong emphasis on the fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I like to give enough material so that students can absorb what?s useful, disregard what is unnecessary, and add what is uniquely their own.” says Ragin. It is like Charlie Parker said, “first you learn the scales, then you forget them.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Drawing from personal experience, Ragin also says, “technique includes the knowledge of the instrument a wall as knowledge of the language.” He attributes his astounding control of the trumpet to studying the basics.

    <h2>Keith Oxman</h2>

    <p>
    Keith Oxman, a Denver, Colorado native, has gigged steadily as a leader and as a sideman for more than 25 years — including a stint on the road with the Buddy Rich Big Band. He has also appeared with artists such as Sonny Stitt, Art Blakey, Jack Mc Duff, Tom Harrell, Jon Hendricks and Mel Tormé. His sound and style are original, and his abilities as a writer make him a force to be reckoned with. And while his original compositions have the qualities to make them standards for tomorrow’s musicians, his arrangements breathe life into little heard standards. An excellent improviser, with a fine sound, agile technique and sure harmonic sense, Keith Oxman can swing like crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Keith is currently the director of bands at East High School in Denver, Colorado.
    </p>

    In addition Mike Marlier and Drew Morell act as substitute directors from time to time.
