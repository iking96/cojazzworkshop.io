    <h1>Do you want to play Jazz in the Denver Metro Area?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Something more than a “kicks” band?</li>
        <li>A link to the great big band jazz experiences of the past?</li>
        <li>An opportunity to strengthen and/or learn jazz improvisation?</li>
    </ul>

        Colorado Jazz Workshop could be what you’re looking for. The big bands of the past had both appreciation for individual musicians and strong leadership. One of the centerpieces of the CJW ensembles are the great directors who drive these groups.
        <br />
        <br />
        Participants in CJW are people who played an instrument in high school or college; some even played professionally in the past. Ultimately they went on to do other things with their lives, e.g., different career, family. At some point they realized they still enjoyed playing and would like to have an outlet to play jazz again. CJW provides this outlet.

        Each week, 3 big bands and six combos get together to play jazz in Denver, Colorado. Come join us and have fun playing and learning more about this great American art form – jazz.
